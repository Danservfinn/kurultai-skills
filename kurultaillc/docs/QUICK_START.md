> Get your LLC formed in ~2 weeks

## Step 1: Answer These Questions (5 min)

1. **What state are you forming in?**
   - Most people form in their home state
   - Delaware/Wyoming/Nevada have benefits but may not save you money

2. **Registered Agent: Yourself or Service?**
   - **Yourself** = Free, but home address becomes public record
   - **Service** = ~$125/year, keeps address private, accepts legal mail
   - Recommendation: Use a service if privacy matters

3. **S-Corp election now or later?**
   - **Wait** if profit < $60k/year (save on payroll costs)
   - **File Form 2553** if profit > $60k/year (save on self-employment tax)
