## Managing Board Dynamics

### When Board Aligns Well
- Lean into them for networks and expertise
- Bring strategic decisions early
- Use them as accountability partners

### When Board Disagrees
- Present data and frameworks (not just opinion)
- Surface disagreements explicitly for debate
- Request 1:1 conversations to understand concerns
- Consider if they're seeing something you're missing

### When Board Micromanages
- Redirect to strategic level (not tactics)
- Proactively communicate more frequently
- Clarify decision rights clearly
- Ask: "What would worry you if we did this?"

## Red Flags: Board Health Issues

- Directors missing multiple meetings consecutively
- Side conversations undermining decisions
- Investor reps coordinating outside meetings
- Founder isolation from independent directors
- Decisions revisited without new information
