# Executive Compensation Philosophy

## Core Principles

### 1. Alignment with Shareholders
- Executive wealth creation tied to shareholder value creation
- Equity-heavy compensation for risk-taking behavior
- Performance-based, not time-based vesting

### 2. Pay for Performance
- Clear metrics tied to strategic objectives
- Asymmetric upside (unlimited) vs. downside (employment)
- Clawback provisions for later-discovered issues

### 3. Market Positioning
- Benchmark against relevant peer set (stage, industry, geography)
- 50th percentile target for cash, 75th for equity (high-growth)
- Premium for scarce skills or experience

## Equity Vesting Structures

- Monthly vesting post-cliff

### Performance Vesting
- 50% time-based (4 years)
- 50% performance-based (milestone achievement)
- Single-trigger or double-trigger (IPO + performance)

### Back-Loaded Vesting (Senior Execs)
- Years 1-2: 20% vested
- Years 3-4: 80% vested
- Encourages retention through key transitions

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-indexing on cash** - Reduces ownership behavior
2. **Too many metrics** - Dilutes focus; aim for 3-5 core KPIs
3. **Short-termism** - Quarterly metrics hurt long-term value
4. **Mismatched incentives** - Don't measure revenue for sales-only roles
5. **Ignoring culture** - Comp drives behavior; you get what you pay for

## Board Approval Process

1. **Compensation Committee** reviews and approves
2. **Full Board** ratifies for CEO and direct reports
3. **Shareholder approval** for equity plans (Plan approval)
4. **Disclosure** in proxy statements (public companies)
