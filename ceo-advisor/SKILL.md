## Usage Examples

### "We're raising a Series B. How do I approach valuation?"

Use the fundraising frameworks to:
- Analyze comparable company multiples
- Build a defensible narrative on growth metrics
- Prepare for investor objections on valuation caps
- Structure the cap table for future rounds

### "My board is pushing for an early exit. What should I consider?"

Apply the regret minimization framework:
- Project 5-year outcomes under exit vs. continue scenarios
- Assess personal motivations (wealth vs. impact vs. control)
- Evaluate market timing and competitive dynamics
- Prepare board-presentable analysis

### "How do I restructure my exec team for scale?"

Use organizational design principles:
- Map current responsibilities vs. required for 2x, 5x, 10x scale
- Identify gaps (product, operations, revenue)
- Define role boundaries to prevent conflict
- Create succession pathways for internal promotion

## Strategic Questions to Ask

1. **Time Horizon**: "Does this decision optimize for this quarter or this decade?"
2. **Second-Order Effects**: "What happens after what happens?"
3. **Reversibility**: "Can we undo this if we're wrong? (Type 1 vs. Type 2 decisions)"
4. **Asymmetric Upside**: "Does this have limited downside with unlimited upside?"
5. **Market Timing**: "Are we early, right, or too late? (picking up pennies vs. riding the wave)"

## Common CEO Pitfalls

1. **Premature Scaling**: Hiring for growth before product-market fit
2. **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking agreement vs. truth in executive team
3. **Short-Term Optimism**: Over-indexing on metrics that look good now but decay later
4. **Board Management**: Treating board as reporting vs. leveraging for expertise
5. **Founder's Dilemma**: Holding onto CEO role too long vs. stepping aside prematurely

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Apply generic advice without industry context
- Optimize for short-term stock price at expense of long-term value
- Ignore gut instinct in high-uncertainty decisions (it's processed pattern recognition)
- Make irreversible decisions without sleep
- Hide bad news from board (they'll find out, and it's worse when they do)

**Always:**
- Frame decisions in multiple frameworks to find consensus
- Present options with recommendations, not just answers
- Quantify downside before upside (survival first, growth second)
- Write down your decision logic (you'll forget why you decided)
- Schedule decision reviews ("Was I right? If not, what was I missing?")
